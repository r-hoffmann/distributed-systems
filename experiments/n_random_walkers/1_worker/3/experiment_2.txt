IMPORTANT 1/2: ONLY SSH INTO NODES WHICH ARE CURRENTLY RESERVED BY YOU

Run 'preserve -llist' to see your reserved nodes.

Connecting to other nodes can disturb experiments,
invalidating months or years of a scientist's work.

IMPORTANT 2/2: DO NOT RUN EXPERIMENTS ON MACHINE FS0

Run 'hostname' to find out on which machine you are currently working.
Experiments should be performed by nodes reserved via preserve.
You can access these nodes via SSH.
